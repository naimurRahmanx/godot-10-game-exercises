# Godot 2D – 10 Game Learning Exercises 🎮

This repository is a **learning journey** through Godot 2D, built by creating **10 small games** from scratch.

The goal is **not polish**, but **understanding**:
- how Godot scenes work
- how signals work
- how game logic is structured
- how to think like a game developer

Each game focuses on **new concepts**, building on the previous ones.

---

## Why this repository exists

I am learning Godot by:
- building small, complete games
- avoiding tutorial hell
- rebuilding things multiple times
- understanding *why* things work, not just *how*

This repo is both:
- a personal learning log
- a reference for other beginners

## How to use this repo

Each folder is a **standalone Godot project**.

To run a game:
1. Open Godot
2. Import the project from the game folder
3. Run the main scene
